# Project Templates

A collection of webapp project templates to demonstrate initial build setups (Grunt / Ant)

gruntjs (http://gruntjs.com/) is currently the preferred build tool for web projects.

The example grunt project uses grunt for:
 * LESS
 * Handlebars template precomilation
 * CSS minification
 * JS minification
 * JS source maps

and includes
 * Bootstrap
 * Underscore.js
 * Handlebars

The ant project is an implementation of the grunt task functionality for older projects still using ant as their build tool.

All components are managed using Bower (https://github.com/bower/bower).
